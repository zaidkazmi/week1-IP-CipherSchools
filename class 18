    <h1>About Ronaldo</h1>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro is a Portuguese soccer superstar. By <mark>2003</mark>— when he was just 16 years old — <em>Manchester United</em> paid £12 million (over $14 million U.S. dollars) to sign him, a record fee for a player of his age. In the 2004<strong> FA Cup final</strong>, Ronaldo scored Manchester's <del>first three goals</del> and helped them capture the championship</p>
    <p>Ronaldos father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristianos name in honour of his fathers favourite movie actor, Ronald Reagan, who was U.S. president at the time of Cristianos birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played <sub>for</sub> Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where he played for that clubs various youth teams before making his debut on Sportings first team in 2002.</p>
